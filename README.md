### In the course of system analysis and design procedures The purpose is for students to analyze the basic steps. Use tools for system analysis, work flow charts, feasibility studies of problems, and analysis of investment worthiness. Import-export and design, computer processing methods Documenting implementation and evaluation, verification, design, and case studies for such purposes. My group therefore chose to analyze the warehouse system and create a case study. To be used to learn and understand basic design according to the course objectives. My group received complete advice and inquiries about problems directly from the parents of one of the group members. My group has designed a new system. To facilitate work and data storage in the areas of picking, counting, and storing However, my group expects that the warehouse system that has been analyzed and redesigned will be of more or less benefit to users.
